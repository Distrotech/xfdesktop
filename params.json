Desktop \r\nin this respect means the root window (or, rather, a window that sits on top\r\nof the root window). The manager handles the following tasks:\r\n- background image / color\r\n- root menu, window list\r\n- minimized app icons\r\n- file icons on the desktop (using Thunar libs)\r\n\r\n\r\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n* intltool 0.34\r\n* GTK+ 2.14.0\r\n* libxfce4util 4.8\r\n* libxfce4ui 4.9\r\n* libwnck 2.22\r\n* libexo 0.6\r\n* xfconf 4.8\r\n* garcon 0.1.2 (optional; required for apps menu)\r\n* thunar 1.2 (optional; required for file icons)\r\n* dbus-glib 0.34  (optional; required for file icons)\r\n* tumbler 1.6 (optional; enables thumbnail previews for file icons)\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDDEN CUSTOMISATIONS\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nIf you're using the icon view, and would like to change how the text looks,\r\nyou have three things you can change: the opacity (transparency) of the\r\nrounded text background, the color of the rounded text background, and the\r\ncolor of the text itself.\r\n\r\nYou'd want to add something like this to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:\r\n\r\nstyle \"xfdesktop-icon-view\" {\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::label-alpha = 75\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::selected-label-alpha = 100\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::ellipsize-icon-labels = 1\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::tooltip-size = 128\r\n\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::shadow-x-offset = 1\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::shadow-y-offset = 1\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::shadow-color = \"#ff0000\"\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::selected-shadow-x-offset = 2\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::selected-shadow-y-offset = 2\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::selected-shadow-color = \"#00ff00\"\r\n\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::cell-spacing = 6\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::cell-padding = 6\r\n    XfdesktopIconView::cell-text-width-proportion = 2.5\r\n\r\n    base[NORMAL] = \"#00ff00\"\r\n    base[SELECTED] = \"#5050ff\"\r\n    base[ACTIVE] = \"#0000ff\"\r\n\r\n    fg[NORMAL] = \"#ff0000\"\r\n    fg[SELECTED] = \"#ff0000\"\r\n    fg[ACTIVE] = \"#ff0000\"\r\n}\r\nwidget_class \"*XfdesktopIconView*\" style \"xfdesktop-icon-view\"\r\n\r\nThe first four entries set the opacity of the rounded text background\r\n(allowed values are from 0 (totally transparent) to 255 (totally opaque),\r\nand whether or not unselected icons get their labels ellipsized\r\n(truncated) to fit on one line.  (The 'selected-' version controls the\r\nopacity of icons that have been selected with the mouse.) The tooltip-size\r\ndetermines how large the image preview will be when the mouse is hovered\r\nover an icon (allowed values are from 0 (not shown) to 512, values larger\r\nthan 256 may cause poor image quality however.)\r\n\r\nThe second six entries can be used to enable a text shadow to be painted\r\nwith the icon labels.  The offsets are in pixels.  Setting them to 0 (the\r\ndefaults) will disable the shadows entirely.  Again, the 'selected-'\r\nversions apply to icons that have been selected with the mouse.\r\n\r\nThe third four entries set spacing and sizing for individual icons on\r\nthe grid.  The 'cell-spacing' property specifies the spacing between each\r\n'cell' in the grid of icons.  The 'cell-padding' property sets extra\r\npadding placed around each icon+text.  The units for these two are in\r\npixels.  The 'cell-text-width-proportion' property specifies the maximum\r\nwidth of the text label underneat the icon, as a multiplier of the icon\r\nwidth (so for 30px icons, '2.5' would leave a 75px wide area underneath\r\nfor the text).\r\n\r\nThe fourth three entries set the color of the rounded text background.\r\n* NORMAL sets the color for the regular, unselected state.\r\n* SELECTED sets the color for when the icon is selected, and the desktop has\r\n  keyboard/mouse focus.\r\n* ACTIVE sets the color for when the icon is selected, but the desktop does\r\n  not have keyboard/mouse focus.\r\n\r\nThe final three entries set the color of the label text.  See above for the\r\ndifferences between NORMAL, SELECTED, and ACTIVE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
